			<h2>Why Choose the Natural Health Acupunture Clinic?</h2>
			<h3>Why Massage Therapy?</h3>
			<h4>Improve circulation, recovery time and immune system function</h4>
			<p class="about">Massage therapy has been proven to boost immune system function. The lymphatic system is a significant aspect of the immune system that contains cells which help to guard us against illness and infection. Massage can increase the effectiveness of the immune system by increasing the distribution of lymphatic fluid.</p>
			<h4>Relax tight, tense muscles</h4>
			<p class="about">When chronic tension builds up in the muscles it subsequently causes a decrease in circulation and nutrient delivery to tissues as well as by-product delivery away from the tissues. Massage therapy promotes blood flow to and from an area where circulation may be compromised, and also gently eases muscle tension.</p>
			<h4>Reduce symptoms of stress</h4>
			<p class="about">People often talk about the psychological benefits of massage therapy. Prolonged periods of stress can negatively affect all body systems. Stress hormones can be detrimental to the body especially over long periods of time. Stress has been shown to aggravate, or even cause problems such as heart disease, gastrointestinal disorders, memory loss, and decreased immune system function. Massage therapy can reduce symptoms of emotional stress, which in turn can reduce the production of stress chemicals in the body.</p>
